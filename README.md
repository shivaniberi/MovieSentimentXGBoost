# üé¨ MovieSentimentXGBoost

An end-to-end **Sentiment Analysis Web App** that predicts whether a movie review is **positive or negative** using **XGBoost** and **scikit-learn** with **TF-IDF text features** and **Flask** for real-time inference.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build, tune, and deploy a sentiment classification model using:
- **XGBoost** for gradient boosting on text data  
- **scikit-learn** for pipeline construction, preprocessing, and model evaluation  
- **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter optimization  
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** for text representation  
- **Flask** for serving model predictions via a web app  

---

## üß† Features
- Trains a movie review sentiment classifier on the **NLTK Movie Reviews dataset**  
- Uses **GPU-accelerated XGBoost** for faster training  
- Implements **GridSearchCV** (scikit-learn) for hyperparameter tuning  
- Combines preprocessing + model in a **scikit-learn Pipeline**  
- Saves and loads models using **joblib**  
- Deploys via a **Flask web app** with both form input and JSON API endpoint
